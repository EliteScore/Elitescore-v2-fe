Problem Statement
Most people sign up for online courses but never 
finish them.
In fact, only about 5 out of 100 peoplecomplete 
a course they enroll in.
The problem is not that courses are bad or too 
hard, it’s that people lack motivation and 
accountability.
Current learning platforms don’t push users to 
stay consistent, and there are no real 
consequences for quitting.
Some platforms use gamification, but it’s easy to 
cheat and there’s no proof that real work was 
done.
Because of this, people lose interest, stop 
learning, and never reach real results.
Mission & Vision
▪ Our mission is to help people finish what they start.
We do this by adding accountability, proof of work, and 
competition to the learning process.
▪ We envision EliteScoreto become a trusted place where 
companies can see real progress, real effort, and real 
skills. Not just certificates but verified consistency and 
completed work. EliteScorebridges learning and hiring by 
making completion and discipline visible.
Culture & Principles
We communicate clearly and respectfully, even 
when we disagree.
We stay close as a team and support each other 
when things get hard.
We respect time by being punctual and reliable.
EliteScoreis a priority, and we do everything in 
our power to make it succeed.
Communication
We schedule regular meetings at least 
2 days in advance.
Emergency meetings can be called on 
the same dayif needed.
We reply to messages as soon as 
possible
We use a Trello boardto track tasks 
and make sure work gets finished. 
Daily communication and quick 
discussions happen on WhatsApp 
groups.
Short-tem
Goals
Our first goal is to achieve more than 60% 
retention, meaning users keep coming back and 
actually use the product.
We aim to have 80–100 active usersusing the 
beta version.
Product quality is a top priority, the app must 
be clean, smooth, secure, and reliable, with no 
hanging or broken flows.
We want strong early marketing by building a 
clear brand image and posting consistent 
Instagram reels.
Our initial market is the universities we are 
currently in, starting with the smallest possible 
niche and capturing a large percentage of it.
We will focus on on-campus marketingand 
direct outreach.
We will track key stats, talk regularly to users, 
understand their needs, and continuously 
validate the idea.
